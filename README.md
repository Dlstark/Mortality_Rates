Include Your Project's Title: 
Life as we know.

Introduction:
What is one thing that everybody has, yet everyone is different? 
Life… Life is the single most important thing a person can have. That is 
why it is so crucial that we sustain and preserve it. How has life been 
for us since 1980 up into 2014? Here we will take a deep dive using big 
data into life expectancy and mortality rates using a few different 
variables. Breaking down every single state by individual county we will 
determine the male and female life expectancy and mortality rate using ages 
0 through 85. My main goal on this journey will be to see how each 
county/state has progressed or regressed over the 34-year span. 


Motivation/why should you care:
The word “life” has always felt so strange to me. Is it just a number with 
age, a long road of A to B, or what you make of it from beginning to end? 
There is so much that plays a factor in it, so I really wanted to dig deep
and look at the life expectancies and mortality rates. What I found was a 
large data set breaking those variables down county by county, state by 
state to see how rates have increased or decreased. I am excited to
breakdown the male and female mortality risks state by state to better
understand how America has progressed from the years 1980 through 2014.
